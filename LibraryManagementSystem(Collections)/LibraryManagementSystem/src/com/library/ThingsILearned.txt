Things I Learned: 

- Primitive data types and objects are two different entities in Java.

- Objects are called reference data types.

- Reason why when you declare a String variable it is written with capital S:
	- String is not a primitive data type but a class from java.lang package
	- Since String is a class, it follows PascalCase naming convention 
	- Whenever we say String <variable> = "", we are instantiating a String object
	
- Objects are stored in heap memory and primitive data types are stored in stack memory (both are a part of RAM)

- What happens during <String text = "Hello"> :
	- text is a reference variable that points to an object of the String class
	- The actual string data "Hello" is stored in the Heap memory
	- The variable text itself (the reference) is stored in the Stack memory
